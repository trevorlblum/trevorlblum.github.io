\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 About urine testing \'91at home\'92
\b0 \
\
As a long-term user of urine test strips, and a program developer, I wanted to make an internet browser version of the classic test-strip process. With the prevalence of mobile phones with adequate photographic capabilities, it seemed that a user imaged test strip could be emailed to the consultant physician, matched against the test reference images and the result reviewed, forwarded where appropriate and filed for progress tracking.\
\
In light of the many test-strip versions, it seemed desirable to design such an entity to cover the three major suppliers, Roche, Livingstone and Siemens, with their Combur9,Multiple Reagent Strips SG10, and Multistix SG10 test series respectively.\
\
The process at the users home site would be to place a tested strip alongside a colour-accurate chart for the photograph in order to ensure that strip and chart would be imaged by the same camera at the same time. The user would then email the image to the physician for analysis and archival after having assessed the image and result profile before sending.\
\
A simple camera stand for the phone and sterilisable plastic bound reference image would be the only extra equipment required for repeatable test results using the inbuilt flash function of the mobile phone.\
\
Once the image was taken, the user would discard the test-strip, wipe the reference chart with a Milton soaked tissue and place it aside for the next test sequence. While gloves would not be needed for any of this, ( the test strips typically have an extended length which is the sole handling requirement ), the use of Milton as a biostat would clear up any spillage or contamination to the plastic-laminated chart.\
\
Production of the laminated charts and the simple stands should be a small expense and a kit for the various manufacturers test-strips would require little production effort. The camera stand could be a 3D-printed additive plastic item or, should volume production be required, injection moulded.\
\
Advantages of this method include fast turnaround and review of test results, minimal time between test and review, no repetitive liquid sample consulting room requirement and archival of test series for progress monitoring by patient and physician \'91in tandem\'92.\
\
A physician might issue small groups of fresh strips ( the cost of 100 strips can be an issue to a user ) ensuring adequate expiry date. Automatic feedback to the client advising progress or change would minimise physician review time and automated test summaries would be archived for medical history records. For the client, a version of the server application with diagnostic and retrospective summaries could provide a prompt for appointment and consultation if a test indicated a deterioration in condition over the archive period.\

Here the test strip is on the left, the reference chart on the centre-and right. User instructions at top left. A touch or click on the test name eg. BLOOD shows a description of the specific test ( see last image on this page )\

\fs36 An online demonstration is available at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://trevorblum.name/Multitest"}}{\fldrslt https://trevorblum.name/Multitest}}. This is a mythical sample in which 9 test patches have been set to a mid-range value/colour to illustrate the meaure of match ( in white above each reference patch eg Leucocytes show a minimum distance of 16, a maximum of 66 ).  A modified test image anomalous Blood patch shows a lower distance of 13, maximum 63) }
