To update box_bin data in mashup.txt, cd to /users/trevorblum/documents/Box_Bin folder.

Then modify the Box_Bin_Contents.csv file and add any new images to images folder.

cd to mashup and run mashup.pde which will create a new mashup in cd ..

Copy ../mashup.txt and the ../images file to trevorblum.name/Box_Bin and trevorblum.github.io/Box_Bin.

Finally run Github desktop and test that trevorblum.name/box_bin queries show the expected changes.

The last change made 7/2/2024 was to add an Arduino_UNO.png image to box 8 Arduino UNO line 115 which previously had only NRF24l01.png
