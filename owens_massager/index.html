<h4>PA-400H_IB massager fault<br><br>
The following entries are a snapshot of the results of a search for information on the hoMEDICS massager.<br>

It appears that some are still available via EBAY. Amazon no longer have them <br>and hoMEDICS no longer list them on their home site, which is not surprising <br>for a device that has been on the market since 2006.<br><br>The EBAY searches:<br>

<br>
In summary, the failed chip is no longer available ( first issued 2003 as a high-volume, <br>preprogrammed unit. Holtek, the maker, is in Taiwan and would not be interested in <br>selling a single chip worth about 10cents each, normally ordered in multiple 1000 unit reels.<br><br>
While the maker site Hackster has some info on other cheap Taiwanese chips, I found no <br>reference to the massager Holtek MCU chip. They do however mention that a great many <br>similar chips were and some still are, available for as little as 3cents<br>

<br>Given hacksters comment that software to program these devices is still available for $500-600US and
<br> that it would be a total guesswork to program this MCU ( even if available ) that is not a viable option. <br><br>It is also the case that most this series of low-cost chips were manufacturer one-time programmed and not user modifiable.<br>

They even produced preprogrammed chips for electric toothbrushes.
<br>
<br>
I think I can see why the PA-400H_IB massagers are not a desirable, profitable, supportable device for commercial sale<br>no matter how useful they may be.<br>
<br>
If you can get hold of one via EBAY, I suggest that would be your cheapest way around the<br> failure of this unit. I also suggest that you keep the dead one in case the replacement unit<br> should fail with a fixable problem, like the 5volt transformer or the many transistors including the <br>MOSFET motor drivers.<br>
